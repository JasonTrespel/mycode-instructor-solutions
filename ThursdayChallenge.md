# Thursday Challenge!

Start by making a file called `switch_cmds.txt` with the following commands in it:

```
show ver
show host
show ip http
show trace
show user
```

Then write a python script that reads in this file and runs all of these commands against `sw-1`, `sw-2`, and the Cisco-NXOS switch (See lab 30 for connection details). 

Print out the responses.

**Taking it further**: Print the responses out as JSON data.

**More furtherer**: Send the JSON data to a file.
